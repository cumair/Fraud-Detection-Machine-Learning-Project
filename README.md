# Machine-Learning-Project
The main goal of this project is the implementation of various data mining and machine learning techniques and their applications. The exploration of multiple data analysis tasks on the targeted data, including both supervised knowledge discovery (predictive modeling) as well as unsupervised knowledge discovery for exploratory data analysis. The basic objective is to create a best predictive model for classifying fraud, whether a claimant is likely to commit fraud in auto insurance claims. This is a pure classification task which also includes the misclassification costs.
