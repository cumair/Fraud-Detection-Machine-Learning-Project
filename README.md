# Machine-Learning-Project
The main goal of this project is the implementation of various data mining and machine learning techniques and their applications. The exploration of multiple data analysis tasks on the targeted data, including both supervised knowledge discovery (predictive modeling) as well as unsupervised knowledge discovery for exploratory data analysis. The basic objective is to create a best predictive model for classifying fraud, whether a claimant is likely to commit fraud in auto insurance claims. This is a pure classification task which also includes the misclassification costs.

To accomplish this goal, some of the important numerical and categorical features are analyzed in relation with the main parameter of interest “fraud_detected”. We experimented and compared with various classifiers provided as part of the scikit-learn machine learning module, as well as with some of its parameters optimization and model evaluation capabilities. In particular, we used the following list of classification algorithms to classify the data:

● K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN)
● Naive Bayes (Gaussian)
● Decision Tree
● Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
● Rocchio
● Random Forest
● Ada Boost
● Gradient Boosting
● Support Vector Machines (SVC Classifier)
● Logistic Regression

The accuracy of the different models were compared to select the final model for prediction. This model can flag potential fraud in insurance claims and can lead to reduction in insurance premiums, claim turnaround time, and increase company’s profitability.
